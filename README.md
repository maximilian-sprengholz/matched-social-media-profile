# Matched Social Media Page

_Version 0.1.0_

For an experiment in the second wave of a panel survey, we use individual social media profiles as a stimulus to signal similarity or difference to a respondent. We estimate similarity/difference via a matching approach using respondent's information from the first wave, and dynamically create a fictitious social media profile for matched individuals.
