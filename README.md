# Matched Social Media Profile

For an experiment in a follow-up wave of a panel survey, individual social media profiles are used as a stimulus to signal similarity or difference to a respondent. We estimate similarity/difference via a matching approach using respondent's information from the prior wave, and dynamically create a fictitious social media profile for matched individuals.
